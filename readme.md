# Andrew's Meal Listing App
Allows you to visually manage the dinners/meal list for a given time period, including providing required quantities of ingredients, ability to adjust serving size of meals, and providing a comprehensive to-do list of ingredients to add to the basket.
I would eventually love to add automatic ordering/adding items to basket for chosen shopping provider(s).

## Basic Requirements
- Add or remove meals from dinner/meal options list.
- Set active dinner/meal list from options set.
- Mark individual meals as eaten/marked off.

## Other Requirements
- List ingredients for each meal.
- List general serving size for meal.
- At the end, provide itemised list of ingredients to buy, with links.

## Add-On Extra's to App
- Include links for each ingredient.
- Allow increase of serving size per meal, which then adjusts ingredient quantities.

## Super Extra Add-On's
- Automatic basket adding of ingredients to chosen provider(s).
